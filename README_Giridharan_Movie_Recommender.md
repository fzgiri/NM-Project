# Delivering Personalized Movie Recommendations with AI-Driven Matchmaking System

This project implements an AI-powered movie recommendation system that delivers personalized suggestions by analyzing user preferences, behavioral patterns, and movie metadata. The system uses advanced machine learning and deep learning models to match users with movies they are most likely to enjoy.

## Project Information

- **Project Title**: Delivering Personalized Movie Recommendations with AI-Driven Matchmaking System
- **Author**: Giridharan.R
- **Date**: 10th May 2025

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations based on user history and preferences
- Hybrid model combining content-based and collaborative filtering
- Dynamic matchmaking system using deep learning for behavioral analysis
- Scalable system that adapts as user profiles evolve
- Interactive user interface for rating and exploring movie matches

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (data processing)
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (ML/DL models)
- Surprise Library (collaborative filtering)
- Flask or Streamlit (for frontend UI)
- MovieLens or IMDb datasets

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Load datasets like MovieLens with user ratings and movie metadata.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Clean, merge and prepare user-item interaction matrices.
3. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Content-based filtering using movie features
   - Collaborative filtering using matrix factorization or KNN
   - Deep learning model for user embedding and matching
4. **User Interface**:
   - Users can rate movies, view suggestions, and see matches
5. **Evaluation**:
   - Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, and Hit Rate to evaluate model performance

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn surprise tensorflow streamlit
```

## Usage

1. Run `data_preprocessing.py` to prepare the dataset.
2. Run `train_model.py` to build the recommendation engine.
3. Launch the app with `streamlit run app.py`.
